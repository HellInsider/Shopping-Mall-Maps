Map = XML document, containing SVG format graphical map + extra data needed

1) Use SVG format for storing actual map
- Add every exit point of each store
- Add passages as transparent lines
- Use XML ID to mark each object according to its type. E.G.: Shop_1_1, Shop_1_2, ... Toilet_2_3, ..., Shop_1_1_Exit_2, ...
	- in this example first number stands for the floor
2) Use QGraphicsSvgItem for drawing (https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qgraphicssvgitem.html#details), usiing XML ID to set needed objects of the map
3) Store extra infromation such as shop titles at the separate part of document in order to be able change it easily without editing SVG picture

TBD:
1) XML ID format
2) Pathing algorithm specificities, which dictate extra items of Map object
3) If we are going to compress map data (approx. 100%-150% upload boost) for server-client interaction?
