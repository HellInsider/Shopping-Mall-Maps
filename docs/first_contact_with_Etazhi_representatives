26.02.21 i've met "Etazhi" representatives (director Svetlana and unnamed women), and had a talk about uor cooperation

Points of discussion:
- they are deeply interested at having navigation app for the loft and have no offer except ours at the moment
- they value their area plans as private commercial intelligence. We need to sign or at least accept offer of some kind on concrete terms to use them
- they like the idea of gratuitous app development, willing to promote our app (and our team) in return
 - in that case thay are fine with our app agregating other places maps
- although they are willing to consider payment in case of strict terms and conditions

State of interatcion:
- i still don't have any way to contact "Etazhi" besides corporate mail
- at least they've got my number now

Sugestions for further operating:
- leave things as they are right now, keep in touch for now
- contact them again once we have running app
